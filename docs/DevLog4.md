#### Goals for this Module

- [Analyze and propose new colors theory for Kirby's Adventure for Case Study ] Goal 1

-->

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - It was fun going through the game again and noticing just how much they could convey with such limited colors. This was one of the late NES games so of course they knew every trick in the book to make the game pretty. But still. 
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  -  Coming up with the new color scheme was hard cause the vibrant and warm colors are such huge aspects of Kirby's aesthetic that it initially didn't feel right going in the opposite direction. 
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  -  Eventually I came up with the idea of using the Analogous colors of purple, red, and orange asthenew color scheme in order to give the game a more surreal look that plays into the plot of the game. 

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
-  Color scheme for a game is just as importatnt as the music and gameplay as one small decision can greatly effect what players take away from it.
