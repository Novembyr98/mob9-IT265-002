#### Goals for this Module

- [Find a way to make the gear system more engaging] Goal 1



#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  -I've decided I'm going to have the gear actually change the damage values for the pieces instead of just the attack and defense stats
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - I found that while player with the gear system as is. Most games boild down to bigger attack vs low defenseand vice versa with no real tension when it came to player
    encounters 
- **Solutions**:
  - I have it so that now when a player encounter a yellow/gear tile. The new weapon changes their damage. Now weapons being weaker or stronger is a core factor to a players 
    life as some weapons can kill them in one hit or not depending on their defense value
