#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - So I've decided that the game will be called Mercopolis (Mercenary + Metropolis) as is ties into the playable characters being
  - hired guns entering a game show to win a chance to enter a luxurious city. I've, as you guess, decided how I'd want to frame the boardgame. It'd be a
  - blood sport gameshow similar to Smash TV but in a dystopian post-war dieselpunk world. I did come up with two ways to incorperate player choice in Mercopolis. One comes during
  - a scenario where one player challenges another to a duel. They can either accept the duel and risk being killed from the game if they have weaker/loot equipment or bribe the player by sacrificing a number of turns or money
  - they currently have. If the player has been resourceful throughout the game, the sacrifice wouldn't hurt them too much. But those with bad gear and lackluster funds who choose it out of desperation may find themselves
  - starting at square one with only luck factoring on if they get win. Though even with weak gear, a player might be able to outplay one with better equipment. I think this adds a layer of risk and strategy to the game that I
  - felt was missing when I initially decided to have battles be a non-optional.
