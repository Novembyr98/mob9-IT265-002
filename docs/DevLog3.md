#### Goals for this Module

- [ Come up with examples of bad mechanics in games I enjoy ] Goal 1
- [ ] Goal 2
- [ ] Goal 3


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - This assignment was quite difficult cause there haven't been too many games I like with mechanics I outright haated or disliked. Moreso I just get kinda annoyed if there's a mechanic I think is iffy. But I did manage to come up with 6 mechanics I felt needed a rework
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  -  Again just the task of coming up with mechanics I thought were bad in games I liked. It's much easier to do it for a game you thought was lukewarm cause your not biased toward the good aspects of it. 
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
