#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - < I was albe to analyze Double Dragon as best as I could. Given it's horrible gameplay and unfair AI, I only made it to Abobo before tapping out. It did help me understand how much visuals and feedback play a key factor in a game.
  - As the lack of those two aspects greatly effected my experience with the game. >
- **Challenges faced**:
